# LooRadar Phase 0 Plan

## Goal

Create the production-ready project foundation before feature implementation begins.

## Phase 0 deliverables

### Repository and Flutter foundation

- initialize Flutter application
- configure Android and iOS application identifiers
- establish folder structure
- enable strict analysis/linting
- add environment/config strategy
- add CI for format, analyze, and tests

### Firebase foundation

- create Firebase project environments as appropriate
- register Android and iOS apps
- configure Firebase Anonymous Authentication
- configure Cloud Firestore
- configure Firebase App Check
- create initial Firestore Security Rules
- create required composite indexes only as queries require them
- preserve the documented public/private data boundary so publicly readable documents never contain contributor UIDs
- document deterministic ownership/enforcement strategy for one active rating per UID per restroom before rating writes are implemented

Do not commit service-account secrets, App Check debug tokens, signing credentials, or unrestricted API keys.

### App Check foundation

Document and configure the environment-appropriate provider strategy:

- supported Firebase debug provider/token workflow for local development/testing;
- Play Integrity for Android production unless platform requirements change;
- App Attest for supported Apple production devices, with DeviceCheck fallback where appropriate;
- verify legitimate release builds before enabling production enforcement.

App Check debug tokens must never be committed.

### Google Maps foundation

- enable Maps SDK for Android
- enable Maps SDK for iOS
- configure platform-restricted API keys
- add development map screen
- show current position only after permission is granted

Avoid enabling unrelated Google Maps Platform APIs during Phase 0.

### Cost and quota guardrails

Before production traffic:

- configure Google Cloud billing budget alerts appropriate to the project/account;
- review available Firebase/Google Cloud usage dashboards and quotas;
- restrict Maps API keys to only the required SDK/API and platform identity;
- avoid enabling unused billable APIs;
- document any service that can incur variable cost;
- do not assume a budget alert is a hard spending cap—design query/API usage controls in the application as well.

### Domain model

Implement typed models for:

- restroom
- rating
- verification
- report

Implement enums rather than arbitrary strings for controlled values.

Domain/public models must not accidentally expose private ownership metadata.

### Location foundation

- foreground location permission only
- permission-denied experience
- lat/lng value object
- geohash generation abstraction
- Haversine distance utility
- nearby-query repository interface
- map viewport query abstraction

### Data access architecture

UI must not call Firestore directly throughout the widget tree.

Use repository/service boundaries so that:

- Firestore can be tested/mocked
- geospatial strategy can be changed later
- PostGIS or another backend can eventually replace Firestore geo queries without rewriting UI

Suggested layering:

```text
presentation
  ↓
application/state
  ↓
domain
  ↓
data repositories
  ↓
Firebase / platform adapters
```

Do not over-engineer with excessive abstractions; preserve clear replacement boundaries around Firebase and GIS-specific operations.

### Security baseline

- authenticated anonymous UID required for contribution writes
- public read access limited to documents intended for public consumption
- contributor UIDs and ownership metadata excluded from publicly readable documents
- validate ownership against `request.auth.uid`; never trust client-supplied identity
- validate latitude range -90..90
- validate longitude range -180..180
- validate controlled enums
- enforce text length limits
- block users from writing aggregate fields directly
- App Check integration and provider strategy

### Testing foundation

Minimum Phase 0 tests:

- latitude/longitude validation
- Haversine distance calculation
- data model serialization/deserialization
- enum parsing
- repository contract test doubles
- permission-state logic where practical
- Firestore Security Rules tests for public/private separation and representative allowed/denied writes once rules are introduced

## Non-goals

Phase 0 does not implement the complete product UX.

Specifically exclude:

- production add-restroom workflow
- ratings UI
- verification/reporting UI
- photos
- donation integration
- advanced moderation
- Places API
- routing APIs

## Definition of done

Phase 0 is complete when:

1. Flutter builds successfully for Android and iOS development targets.
2. CI passes format/analyze/tests.
3. Firebase initializes successfully.
4. Anonymous authentication produces a usable UID.
5. App Check is wired for development/testing and the Android/iOS production provider and enforcement strategy is documented.
6. Google Maps renders successfully using appropriately restricted client keys.
7. Foreground location permission is handled correctly.
8. Current location can be represented on the map without persisting location history.
9. Domain/data repository boundaries are in place.
10. Geo utilities and core models have passing tests.
11. Firestore public/private document separation is represented in rules/tests so contributor UID is not exposed by public reads.
12. No secret credentials/debug tokens are committed to the repository.
13. Google Cloud/Firebase budget alerts and cost/usage monitoring approach are documented/configured before production use.
14. No unnecessary billable Google Maps Platform APIs are enabled for the Phase 0 implementation.

## Next phase

Phase 1 should implement **Map Discovery**:

- nearby restroom query
- viewport querying
- marker rendering
- clustering
- restroom preview card
- nearby list
- initial filters
