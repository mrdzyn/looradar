# LooRadar

LooRadar is a global, community-powered restroom finder focused on helping people quickly locate nearby toilets/comfort rooms, see practical details, contribute new locations, rate facilities, and verify whether listings are still usable.

## Project goals

- Global coverage from day one
- Map-first discovery of nearby restrooms
- No traditional account required for normal use
- Privacy-conscious design with minimal personal data
- Community-contributed locations, ratings, amenities, and verification
- Low operating cost using Google Maps + Firebase/Google Cloud free allowances where practical
- Simple path to scale without premature infrastructure complexity

## Initial stack

- Flutter (iOS + Android)
- Google Maps SDK for map visualization
- Firebase Anonymous Authentication
- Cloud Firestore
- Firebase App Check
- Firebase Storage for photos later
- Optional Cloud Run / Cloud Functions only where server-side enforcement is required
